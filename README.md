# VRCTextboxOSC

An OSC application to communicate with VRChats new "Text Chatbox" system. This can directly replace the in game Keyboard for the Chat box and update it in real time! (With a bit of a delay tho) <br><br>
I has two modes:
- Auto update 
  - Continuosly Updates the textbox with your written text. Pressing enter clears the Chatbox.
  - Continuous Writing: When the maximum Character limit is reached it removes the first word so you can continue typing.
- Manually send by pressing enter or the send button.

NEW: 
  - Added "Set Window Always on top" mode,
  This is useful for _Desktop Users_ who want to keep the textbox app window ontop of all other apps.
